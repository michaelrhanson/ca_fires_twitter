destroyed at least 34 homes, reportedly including that of the local fire chief. That's a dozen more than officials had originally estimated.</p>
<p>"It's a little challenging," said Pfeiffer Ridge resident Tara Evans, who says she plans to spend Christmas Eve helping her sister, who lost her home in the blaze. During the evacuation, "We could look back down and see it burning," she said. Evans put the best face on the tragedy. "We're going to dig in and help them out," she said. "It's certainly going to be a joyous Christmas, to be back at home. We got out with our lives."</p>
<p>Designated as the <a title="Inciweb - Pfeiffer" href="http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/3761/">Pfeiffer Fire</a>, the blaze began around midnight of December 17th and led to evacuations along Pfeiffer Ridge Road and burned more than 900 acres in the Los Padres National Forest west of Highway 1. Authorities declared the fire <a title="Monterey Herald - post" href="http://www.montereyherald.com/news/ci_24762072/big-sur-fire-running-out-steam">fully contained</a> on Saturday. Incident Commander Kevin Poyner says that at its peak, as close to 1,000 firefighters and support personnel joined the effort.</p>

(USFS/Inciweb)" width="489" height="283"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Pfeiffer Fire consumed more than 900 acres. (USFS/Inciweb)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Authorities said that damage assessment teams had completed "preliminary" surveys over the weekend and found little remaining of some homes. About 100 residents were displaced, at least temporarily. Evans, who says she was "born and raised in Big Sur," and been through several fires and road closures in the region, says, "Each time the community seems to come together stronger. The love and support we get from our neighbors literally blows me away."</p>
<p>Evans, whose own home was spared, says neighbors were able to save some homes by pumping water out of a 30,000-gallon swimming pool. She nonetheless describes this fire as "incredibly hot" and "one of the more devastating" that she can recall. The fire was somewhat <a title="NF - post" href="http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2013/12/18/121124/">unusual for this time of year</a>, when forests would normally be sodden by now with winter rains. But Evans says the particular spot where her home is located hadn't burned in about 100 years, so a large amount of fuel had accumulated.</p>

<p>Published reports on Monday said that Forest Service officials were <a title="Monterey Herald - post" href="http://www.montereyherald.com/news/ci_24784100/forest-service-big-sur-fire-cause-be-revealed">close to determining</a> what caused the fire but on Tuesday, Poyner told KQED that the fire is "still under investigation" and there is "no timeline" for an announcement of the cause.</p>

Keep in mind that the Postal Service must postmark your ballot envelope by the end of Election Day for your vote to count — and the last collection at many mailboxes is 5 p.m. If it's getting late in the day on November 8, you might consider using a county drop box instead of a USPS mailbox."},{"question":"What if I make a mistake on my ballot?","answer":"Some counties will provide written instructions on how to correct a mistake on your ballot, such as voting for a candidate you didn't intend to. But if you clearly mark your intended choice — say, by x-ing out your mistake — your vote can still be counted."},{"question":"What if I made a mistake with my ballot signature?","answer":"Your ballot will not be counted if the envelope is unsigned or if the signature doesn't match the signature in your voter registration file. Typically, the signature on file is the same as the signature pictured on the front of your driver's license or state ID. County election officials can reach out to you to correct a missing or mismatched signature in order to count your ballot, even after election day."},{"question":"How do I track my ballot once I’ve returned it?","answer":"All registered voters in California can sign up for an online tool to track the status of their mail-in ballots for the November general election. \u003ca href='https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-status/wheres-my-ballot' target='_blank'>\"Where's My Ballot?\"\u003c/a> provides automated notifications via email, text or phone when your county elections offices have mailed out your ballot — and when your completed ballot has been received and processed."},{"question":"Can I still vote in-person?","answer":"Yes. In Contra Costa, San Francisco and Solano counties, you will be assigned to a specific location for in-person voting.
