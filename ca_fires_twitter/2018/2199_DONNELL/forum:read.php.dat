During morning hours the fire is under an inversion and actively burning in timber and brush, with movement driven primarily by terrain. Once the inversion lifts around noon, the winds in the canyon increase to 25 mph, causing the fire to drastically increase its rate of speed. Aircraft are restricted in the morning due to smoky conditions and the inversion, but also restricted later in the day due to high winds.<br /><br />The Donnell Fire ignited at 5:49 p.m. Aug. 1, 2018 near Donnell Lake on Highway 108 east of Pinecrest. The fire has burned about 500 acres with active fire behavior and smoke outputs in two-foot high brush, timber litter and understory. The fire is burning to the northeast.<br /><br />The fire’s objectives includes firefighter and public safety; protection, maintenance and enhancement of natural and cultural resources.

The fire is burning primarily along the north bank of the Middle Fork of the Stanislaus River in steep and rough terrain with heavy standing dead and down timber. The fire is being managed as full suppression incident from the start. Due to the other large fires in the region and state, resources are being ordered and filled as they are available. Other local incident management teams are sharing aircraft and personnel as needed.<br /><br />Yesterday afternoon, strong winds pushed the fire northeast into the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness and across the Clark Fork Road towards Bald Peak. The fire grew by about 5,000 acres and is now 5,814 acres. The Red Flag Warning expired last night, however, weather patterns are expected to be similar today with slightly lower winds than as yesterday. Aircraft are assisting firefighters within the river canyon. The fire burned into the 2017 McCormick Fire, slowing its growth on the northeast flank.<br /><br />Today, crews will monitor and prep for structure protection along Highway 108. Crews cleared vegetation around the Double Dome repeater last night and will continue to monitor the site today.<br /><br />Yesterday, California Highway Patrol closed Highway 108 eastbound at the Eagle Meadow Rd. and westbound at Dardanelle Resort. A mandatory evacuation was implemented in the area, including all campgrounds and residences. Today, the evacuation will be extended to Kennedy Meadows.<br /><br />As of 6 am today, the Central Coast Interagency Incident Management Team (Lee Rickard, IC) assumed management of the fire.<br /><br />Visitors and residents are advised that smoke to the west of Pinecrest is likely coming from the Ferguson Fire.<br /><br />Currently, the Pacific Crest Trail at Sonora Pass is open, but hikers are advised there may be smoke impacts on the trail.<br /><br />SIGNIFICANT EVENTS: Mandatory evacuation from Highway 108 at Eagle Meadow Road to Kennedy Meadows was implemented at 9 am today.<div class="message-options"><a class="icon icon-comment-add" rel="nofollow" href="https://yosemitenews.info/forum/read.php?3,92750,92755#REPLY">Reply</a>

Significant decrease in both fire activity and threats to structures allowed firefighters to continue progress on containment. Night crews were pulled off the line at midnight and rotated in this morning with the day crews to assist with patrol efforts. Increased personnel on the fire line and additional heavy equipment will provide more resources for fire containment. The thunderstorm over the eastern portion of the fire yesterday produced little rain and did not increase fuel moisture levels to help firefighting efforts.<br /><br />Firefighters are working hard to keep the established containment lines in place while making progress. Upcoming weather is predicted to be hotter and drier with winds from the southwest. This may make for more difficult fire-fighting conditions in the coming days. Overwhelming support from the local community is bolstering firefighter morale allowing them to push through incredibly tough terrain and fatigue.<br /><br />Forest Closures: The area includes the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness on the Summit and Calaveras Ranger Districts as well as Spicer Reservoir. Campgrounds are open, but the lake is closed to visitor use. Highway 108 is still closed at Eagle Meadow Road from the west and at the top of Sonora Pass on the east side. The<br />Alpine County Sheriff’s Office has closed the gate at the junction of Highway 4 and Highlands Lake Road (Forest Service Road 8N01). The Pacific Crest Trail has also been closed between Highway 108 and Highway 4 for public safety.<br /><br />Mandatory Evacuations: Still in effect along Highway 108 from Eagle Meadow Road to Kennedy Meadows (all residences and campgrounds) as well as all along Eagle Meadow Road (5N01) and the Clark Fork Road area. No new mandatory evacuations have been ordered.<br /><br />Advisory Evacuation: Mill Creek area was put into effect on August 8.<br /><br />For more information about the Stanislaus National Forest, visit us at <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/stanislaus" target="_blank" >http://www.fs.usda.gov/stanislaus</a>.<br /><br />For more information on the fire please go to <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6092/" target="_blank" >https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6092/</a>.<div class="message-options"><a class="icon icon-comment-add" rel="nofollow" href="https://yosemitenews.info/forum/read.php?3,92750,92831#REPLY">Reply</a>

Fire activity in this area increased due to steep, dense vegetation, dry fuels and gusty south and southwestern winds. Uncommon fire activity at night has been observed in the northwestern portion of the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. Expect increased aviation in the area as air tankers and helicopters make multiple drops to try to moderate fire activity. Hiram historic cabin has been wrapped with fire resistant material and vegetation cleared to protect the structure in the event fire continues to spread north. Additional containment line was completed on the northwest and southeast portions of the fire. With the current conditions including warming temperatures, lower humidity, increased winds up to 25 mph and low fuel moistures, vegetation is incredibly receptive to long distance spotting. Moderate fire activity remains on the northeastern and eastern edges of the fire. Hazard tree mitigation continues along Highway 108.<br /><br />We will be heading into a drier and warmer period through the weekend along with gusty afternoon west to southwest winds. This may make for more active fire conditions in the coming days.<br /><br />Fire personnel are maintaining an excellent accident and injury record. Support from the local community continues to bolster firefighter morale.<br /><br />Current Closures:<br />August 4: California Highway Patrol closed Highway 108 at Eagle Meadow Road from the west and at the top of Sonora Pass on the east side.<br />August 6: U.S. Forest Service closed the Pacific Crest Trail between Highway 108 and Highway 4 for public safety.<br />August 9: Alpine County Sheriff’s Office closed the gate at the junction of Highway 4 and Highland Lakes Road (Forest Service Road 8N01).<br />August 9: U.S. Forest Service signed the Fire Closure Order restricting public access within and adjacent to the fire.<br /><br />Mandatory Evacuations: Still in effect along Highway 108 from Eagle Meadow Road to Kennedy Meadows (all residences and campgrounds) as well as all along Eagle Meadow Road (5N01) and the Clark Fork Road area.

The western edge showed little spread. Yesterday crews were able to get a good line in and made significant progress with containment in this area. Today, additional crews and aircraft are working to complete the line near Spicer Reservoir. A small portion of the fire remains active north of Highway 108 and Kennedy Meadows due to steep rugged terrain and patchy vegetation. Crews are working to complete the last short segment of containment line south of Highway 108 between Douglas Picnic Area and the Bennett Juniper. Portable pumps and hose were brought in to support hand crews. Mop up and suppression repair continues along the southern fire boundary.<br /><br />Drier weather, lower humidity and increased west to southwesterly winds may intensify fire activity this afternoon.

Fire resources will continue to confine and contain fire spread, with the priority remaining in the northern most portion of the fire. Fire suppression repair on the southern portion of the fire area continues to be a priority for the forest Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) Team. This is the immediate post fire action taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activity.<br /><br />Weather conditions will continue with a warming and drying trend over the fire area through the next several days. Conditions will be slightly above normal, with the potential for afternoon heating to produce some cumulus buildups near the crest of the sierra during the afternoon.<br /><br />A Revised Forest Closure Order (STF-16-2018-12) was issued on August 30, 2018 to open up areas of the Stanislaus National Forest not directly affected by the Donnell Fire. This revised order supersedes the previous forest closure order (STF-16-2018-11). The revised order opens up Bull Run Lake on the Calaveras Ranger District. On the Summit Ranger District, it opens up the south side of Hwy 108 between Kennedy Meadow and Sonora Pass, the Sonora Pass Trailhead, and the trail from Kennedy Meadow to Relief Reservoir (Trail 20E11). Active fire, fire suppression actions, hazardous standing trees, and risk from rock fall provide clear indicators that the fire area is still dangerous and the public is restricted from entering the current closure area.<br /><br />Forest Closure Area: The forest area impacted by the fire remains closed. This includes all residences and campgrounds along Eagle Meadow Road (5N01), the Highway 108 corridor, and the Clark Fork Road area. Property owners may obtain permits for access through the Summit Ranger District. Spicer Reservoir is closed but the campgrounds remain open. Highland Lakes Road (8N01) is open to Tryon Meadow only – Highland Lakes Campground and Trailhead are closed.

All personnel were notified of the incoming thunderstorm, and efforts were made to notify any public that may have been in the area. The fall rainy season is upon us, and severe mountain thunderstorms can develop quickly with little to no warning. The recent fire in conjunction with rainfall has the potential to produce landslides over the affected area. The Stanislaus National Forest Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) Team is currently working on their soil assessment regarding the burn severity for the Donnell Fire. Crews will be assessing throughout the day any resource damage created by yesterday’s thunderstorms.<br /><br />Weather conditions are expected to be similar to yesterday through Thursday. Temperatures will be slightly above normal, with the potential for afternoon heating to produce some cumulus buildups near the crest of the sierra during the afternoon. We will continue to update you with any threats over the fire area.<br /><br />A Revised Forest Closure Order (STF-16-2018-12) was issued on August 30, 2018 to open up areas of the Stanislaus National Forest not directly affected by the Donnell Fire. This revised order supersedes the previous forest closure order (STF-16-2018-11). The revised order opens up Bull Run Lake on the Calaveras Ranger District. On the Summit Ranger District, it opens up the south side of Hwy 108 between Kennedy Meadow and Sonora Pass, the Sonora Pass Trailhead, and the trail from Kennedy Meadow to Relief Reservoir (Trail 20E11). Active fire, fire suppression actions, hazardous standing trees, and risk from rock fall provide clear indicators that the fire area is still dangerous and the public is restricted from entering the current closure area.<br /><br />Forest Closure Area: The forest area impacted by the fire remains closed. This includes all residences and campgrounds along Eagle Meadow Road (5N01), the Highway 108 corridor, and the Clark Fork Road area. Property owners may obtain permits for access through the Summit Ranger District. Spicer Reservoir is closed but the campgrounds remain open. Highland Lakes Road (8N01) is open to Tryon Meadow only – Highland Lakes Campground and Trailhead are closed.

Pacific Valley Campground is open but the trails at the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness boundary are closed.<br /><br /><i>OPEN:</i> Highway 108 for through traffic only – please do not stop while we continue to work between Eagle Meadow Road (5N01) and Sonora Pass. Kennedy Meadows Resort, Relief Reservoir, Baker Campground, and Deadman Campground are open. Bull Run Lake and the trails leading to it are open.<br /><br />For more information about the Stanislaus National Forest, visit: <a href="http:///www.fs.usda.gov/stanislaus" target="_blank" >http:///www.fs.usda.gov/stanislaus</a><div class="message-options"><a class="icon icon-comment-add" rel="nofollow" href="https://yosemitenews.info/forum/read.php?3,92750,92902#REPLY">Reply</a>
